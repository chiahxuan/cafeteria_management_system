In this cyber day and age where education is viewed with utmost importance by society, universities are constructed in highly-populated locations with abundance of students. This may lead to the congestion of people in that particular university where students who want to acquire a simple meal to eat may have to wait in a long queue for their turns. Not only is it irritating to wait for a long period of time, it is also wasting our precious time that the students can use to seek knowledge. Nevertheless, a healthy person would still have to eat a proper meal regardless of time needed to acquire a proper meal. Therefore, such issue may reflect badly on the reputation of that university as complaints regarding this problem keeps piling up.

Hence, an efficient system must be created to solve all these problems. With today’s technology and tools, it is no exaggeration to say that it is easy to construct a system for the sole purpose of solving a problem given enough effort, time and budget.

OBJECTIVE: 
This project will consist of creating a non-marketable meal debit system for APU’s cafeteria use only. The project will be completed by 19th April 2019, divided into multiple iterations of prototypes to be viewed and approved by the cafeteria manager of APU. The objectives of this project are listed as below
1.	To construct a reliable and secure meal debit system which is capable of cashless transaction.
2.	To build a system capable to recording and tracking each transaction made by an account of a student that is stored in its database. 
3.	To reduce the need of using a cash-based transaction which is time-consuming and insecure.
4.	To allow the admin manager and food vendor owners to have a platform that enables them to monitor and manage their business through the system.
